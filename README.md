# Modulus of Elasticity Calculation Using Shore Hardness

A project to estimate the modulus of elasticity (MoE) using Shore hardness measurements.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for calculating the modulus of elasticity based on Shore hardness data based on equations from ASTM D2240. The approach is useful for materials science and engineering applications. 

## Features

- Data processing and analysis
- MoE estimation from Shore hardness
- Example datasets and usage instructions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MoElasticityUsingShoreHardness.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Main script for analysis
